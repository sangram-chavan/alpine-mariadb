## What is Alpine Linux?
Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. Read more about Alpine Linux here and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.

## What is MariaDB?
MariaDB Server is one of the most popular database servers in the world. Itâ€™s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source.

MariaDB turns data into structured information in a wide array of applications, ranging from banking to websites. It is an enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL. MariaDB is used because it is fast, scalable and robust, with a rich ecosystem of storage engines, plugins and many other tools make it very versatile for a wide variety of use cases.

MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database it provides an SQL interface for accessing data. The latest versions of MariaDB also include GIS and JSON features.

## Features

* Minimal size only, minimal layers
* Memory usage is minimal on a simple install.
* MariaDB the MySQL replacement


## Architectures

* ```:amd64```, ```:x86_64``` - 64 bit Intel/AMD (x86_64/amd64)

##### PLEASE CHECK TAGS BELOW FOR SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES, THE ABOVE IS A LIST OF EXPLANATION

## Tags

* ```:latest``` latest branch based

## Layers & Sizes

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-amd64-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)
![MicroBadger Layers (tag)](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/sangram/alpine-mariadb/amd64.svg?style=for-the-badge)
![MicroBadger Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/image-size/sangram/alpine-mariadb/amd64.svg?style=for-the-badge)


## Volume structure

* `/var/lib/mysql`: Database files
* `/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin`: MariaDB logs


## Environment Variables:

### Main Mariadb parameters:
* `MYSQL_DATABASE`: specify the name of the database
* `MYSQL_USER`: specify the User for the database
* `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: specify the User password for the database
* `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: specify the root password for Mariadb

## Creating an instance


```bash
docker run -it --name mariadb -p 3306:3306 -v /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mysqldb -e MYSQL_USER=mysqluser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqluserpwd -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysqlrootpwd sangram/alpine-mariadb

```

It will create a new db, and set mysql root password (default is RaNd0MpA$$W0Rd generated by pwgen) unless the data already exists.

### Configuration without a cnf file
Many configuration options can be passed as flags to mysqld. This will give you the flexibility to customize the container without needing a cnf file. For example, if you want to change the default encoding and collation for all tables to use UTF-8 (utf8mb4) just run the following:

```bash
docker run --name some-mariadb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d sangram/alpine-mariadb --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

command:
  - --character-set-server=utf8
  - --collation-server=utf8_bin
  - --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp=1

### Initializing a fresh instance
When a container is started for the first time, a new database with the specified name will be created and initialized with the provided configuration variables. Furthermore, it will execute files with extensions .sh, .sql and .sql.gz that are found in /entrypoint-initdb.d. Files will be executed in alphabetical order. You can easily populate your mariadb services by mounting a SQL dump into that directory and provide custom images with contributed data. SQL files will be imported by default to the database specified by the MYSQL_DATABASE variable.


## Docker Compose example:

##### (Please pass your own credentials or let them be generated automatically, don't use these ones for production!!)

```yalm
mysql:
  image: sangram/alpine-mariadb
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: mysqlrootpasswd
    MYSQL_DATABASE: mysqldb
    MYSQL_USER: mysqluser
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: mysqluserpasswd
  expose:
    - "3306"
  volumes:
    - /data/mariadb/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
  restart: always
```
